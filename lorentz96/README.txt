The data for this filtering task, a modified version of the Lorentz 96 model, can be found in lor_96.csv. I loaded the data using a pandas dataframe, so that's the easiest way to retrieve it. If you do, the column labels are 0-99, indexing the components of this 100 dimensional model. The index of the dataframe is the timestep for the values in the row. The model has had noised added to the output after simulating the ODE. The details of generating the data can be found in lorentz_filtering_task.py, and the timestepping methods for the particles can be found in lorentz_96.py The function is called step_particles and takes in a list of particle positions and the desired timestep. It also has an optional variable for problem dimension, which I have set to be 100 in accordance with the full problem.
